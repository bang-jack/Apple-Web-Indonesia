## Introduction
I started to build this project because every month we have show our project. In this time, I built a simple landing page project. The project takes inspiration from the Apple website (Indonesia). The project is built with Bootstrap 5 (css framework) and Swiper.js (javascript library). In addition, the website is responsive enough to be opened on various screens. The website contains some content about Apple products, such as the iPhone 14 Pro, MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, etc. In addition, there is also an img slider (carousel) that presents various models from the iPhone 14 Pro and Apple TV+ swiper.

## Why I choose Apple?
I know there are lots of web inspiration flying on the internet. However, I think Apple website has unique UI/UX design and friendly for beginner to imitate, though it's quite challenging.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* HTML & CSS (Of course)
* Bootstrap 5 (Grid System, Carousel, Flex, Collapse)
* Swiper Js (Coverflow Effect Swiper)

## Strenghts
* The navbar can provide lots of information about products and services
* It has a carousel after the navbar which it contains iPhone 14 Pro models
* The grid system is quite useful to wrap product box

## Weakness
* Navbar menu cannot close automatically when the cursor is clicked on other menu
* Img can be auto-extended in width, not height yet.
* In mobile screen, the footer has same design as the wider one (laptop or monitor)
